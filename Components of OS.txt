There are various components of an Operating System to perform well defined tasks. Though most of the Operating Systems 
differ in structure but logically they have similar components. 
Each component must be a well-defined portion of a system that appropriately describes the functions, inputs, and outputs.

There are following 8-components of an Operating System:

*Process Management
*I/O Device Management
*File Management
*Network Management
*Main Memory Management
*Secondary Storage Management
*Security Management
*Command Interpreter System

Following section explains all the above components in more detail:

Process Management

    Process is an entity which represents the basic unit of work implemented in the system. 
The process management component manages the multiple processes running simultaneously 
on the Operating System.

The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with process management:

*Create, load, execute, suspend, resume, and terminate processes.
*Switch system among multiple processes in main memory.
*Provides communication mechanisms so that processes can communicate with each others
*Provides synchronization mechanisms to control concurrent access to shared data to keep shared data consistent.
*Allocate/de-allocate resources properly to prevent or avoid deadlock situation.

I/O Device Management
        
           I/O Device Management provides an abstract level of H/W devices and keep the details from applications to ensure
proper use of devices, to prevent errors, and to provide users with convenient and efficient programming environment.

Following are the tasks of I/O Device Management component:

*Hide the details of H/W devices
*Manage main memory for the devices using cache, buffer, and spooling
*Maintain and provide custom drivers for each device.

File Management
       
        File management is one of the most visible services of an operating system. A files is a sequence of bits, bytes, lines or records 
whose meaning is defined by its creator and user.
       The operating system implements the abstract concept of the file by managing mass storage 
device, such as types and disks. Also files are normally organized into directories to ease their use.

The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with file management:

*File creation and deletion
*Directory creation and deletion
*The support of primitives for manipulating files and directories
*Mapping files onto secondary storage
*File backup on stable (nonvolatile) storage media

Network Management
 
       A computer network is a collection of various types of computers connected with each other.Network management comprises 
fault analysis, maintaining the quality of service, provisioning of networks, and performance management.
Network management is the process of keeping your network healthy for an efficient communication between different computers.
Following are the features of network management:

*Network administration
*Network maintenance
*Network operation
*Network provisioning
*Network security

Main Memory Management
      
       Main memory is a volatile storage device which means it loses its contents in the case of system failure or as soon as system power goes down.
The main motivation behind Memory Management is to maximize memory utilization on the computer system.

The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connections with memory management:

*Keep track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom.
*Decide which processes to load when memory space becomes available.
*Allocate and deallocate memory space as needed.

Secondary Storage Management
      The main purpose of a computer system is to execute programs. These programs, together with the data 
they access, must be in main memory during execution. Since the main memory is too small to permanently 
accommodate all data and program, the computer system must provide secondary storage to backup main memory.
      Most programs, like compilers, assemblers, sort routines, editors, formatters, and so on, are stored on the disk until 
loaded into memory, and then use the disk as both the source and destination of their processing.

The operating system is responsible for the following activities in connection with disk management:

*Free space management
*Storage allocation
*Disk scheduling

Security Management

        Security Management refers to a mechanism for controlling the access of programs, processes, 
or users to the resources defined by a computer controls to be imposed, together with some means of enforcement.
   For example,
                Memory addressing hardware ensure that a process can only execute within its own address 
space.

Command Interpreter System

        One of the most important component of an operating system is its command interpreter. The command interpreter is the primary interface 
between the user and the rest of the system.
        Command Interpreter System executes a user command by calling one or more number of underlying system programs or system calls.
