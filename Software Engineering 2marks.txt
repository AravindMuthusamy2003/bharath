Software engineering 
                             
      It is a systematic engineering approach to software development. 
A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering
to design, develop, maintain,test, and evaluate computer software. 

‚ÄèCharacteristics of Software Engineering
 
Software Characteristics are classified into six major components:
                        *Functionality 
                        *Portability
                        *Maintainability
                        *Usability 
                        *Efficiency 
                        *Reliabilty 

SDLC Life Cycle
      SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a
detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The
life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development
process.

*Analysis
       System analysis uncovers what software does and how it should behave. 

*Design
       Software design is the process of envisioning and defining software solutions to one
or more sets of problems.
