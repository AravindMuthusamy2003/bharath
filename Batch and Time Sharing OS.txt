Time sharing OS

    Time sharing OS allows the user to perform more than one task at a time, each 
task getting the same amount of time to execute. Hence, the name time sharing OS.
Multiple jobs are running at the CPU time and also, they use the CPU
simultaneously. But, the switching between the tasks is very fast due to which the
user feels that all tasks are running at the same time.

• Active State: 
                   This is the state of the process which is currently processing on
the CPU. Only, one process is in the active state at a time.
 
• Ready State: 
                  In this state, the process is ready for execution but, it is waiting
for its turn to use the CPU. More than one process can be in the ready state at
a time.

• Waiting State:
                In this state, the process is not ready for execution. It is
waiting for some input/output process to get complete.

Batch Operating System

    The batch operating system grouped jobs that perform similar functions. These job groups are treated as a batch and
executed simultaneously. A computer system with this operating system performs the following batch processing
activities:

1.A job is a single unit that consists of a preset sequence of commands, data, and programs.

2.Processing takes place in the order in which they are received, i.e., first come, first serve.

3.These jobs are stored in memory and executed without the need for manual information.

4.When a job is successfully run, the operating system releases its memory.
